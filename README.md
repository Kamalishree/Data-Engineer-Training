A structured daily log of my Data Engineering training journey. This repository includes assignments, quizzes, and mini-projects on core topics such as SQL, MongoDB, Python for data processing, Spark, Azure Databricks, Airflow, and DevOps pipelines. Each module is broken down with hands-on exercises to reinforce theoretical concepts with real-world applications.
